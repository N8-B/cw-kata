# CoverWallet Frontend Developer Coding Exercise

This is the source code for the coding exercise for the CoverWallet software developer position.

A working demo can be found (here)[https://github.com/N8-B].

### Coding Exercise Notes

**Development Tools and Tech:**
- Webpack and Babel used for compiling, bundling and building JavaScript, CSS/SASS, fonts and images.
- React used for client-side views.
- All styles are written in Sass with the Bourbon and Neat libraries.
- Code written in Atom.io IDE alongside Chrome and the Chrome Developer Tools.
- Site mock-up is responsive and has been tested in IE, Chrome and FF.

**Hidden Message:**
HTML comment from the header of the software developer job opening page. Nice!

**TODO:**
- Add React Router and hook up routing for the dashboard section views.
- Revisit/refactor grid for the section content views. Perhaps a the use of ul/li for the notification section would be simpler (i.e. less ugly).

### Installation

To run this on your machine, clone or download this repo, cd into the root of the directory and run ´npm install´.

Once all of the dependencies have been installed, run ´npm start´. This will kick off Webpack and fire up the dev-server on ´localhost:8080´.

If you have any questions, feel free to get in touch.

Thanks!
